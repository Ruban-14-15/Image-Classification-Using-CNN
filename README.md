We learn about image classification using CNNs. Image classification assigns images to categories, while CNNs excel at recognizing objects in images. Using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, the presenter classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 classes. The includes building and training a CNN, and evaluating predictions.
